Mobile Clickers is a software project developed at CITY College, an International Faculty of the University of Sheffield as a part of the Industrial Software Project module at the MSc in Software Engineering and Telecommunication. The projects aim is to develop an educational mobile application which will encourage student's participation in the classroom by allowing them to answer (vote) on many of the questions raised on the lecturer's lecturer notes with the use of just their mobile phone!


The answers (votes) on every question will then be stored on a central server which the lecturer can access and view various kinds of statistics.

Important to note is that the voting is anonymous!!!
